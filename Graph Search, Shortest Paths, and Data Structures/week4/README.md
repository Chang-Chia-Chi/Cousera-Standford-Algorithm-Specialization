# Two sums using hashtable

The goal of this problem is to implement a variant of the 2-SUM algorithm covered in this week's lectures.

The file contains 1 million integers, both positive and negative (there might be some repetitions!).This is your array of integers, with the i^{th}i 
th
  row of the file specifying the i^{th}i 
th
  entry of the array.

Your task is to compute the number of target values tt in the interval [-10000,10000] (inclusive) such that there are distinct numbers x,yx,y in the input file that satisfy x+y=tx+y=t. (NOTE: ensuring distinctness requires a one-line addition to the algorithm from lecture.)

Write your numeric answer (an integer between 0 and 20001) in the space provided.
