# Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them

## Concepts Learned
shortest paths (Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Johnson), NP-completeness and what it means for the algorithm designer, and strategies for coping with computationally intractable problems (analysis of heuristics, local search).
